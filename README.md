# CN-TQB-Collocation-Method
Solves singularly perturbed parabolic convection-diffusion-reaction equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The method uses the Crank-Nicolson scheme for time discretization and Trigonometric Quintic B-splines to approximate spatial derivatives on an exponentially graded mesh.
